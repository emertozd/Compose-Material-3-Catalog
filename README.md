# Compose Material3 Expressive Catalog

This is a standalone version of the **Compose Material3 Expressive Catalog**, extracted from the **AndroidX repository**. It showcases various Jetpack Compose components and Material Design elements.

## Why This Project?

The Compose Material Catalog's source code lives in **AOSP** to ensure it stays up to date with the latest **Compose Material API** and samples. However, accessing and building the app requires working with the **AndroidX** repo, which can be cumbersome due to its size.

This standalone app was created by extracting the Catalog from the AndroidX source, making it easier for developers to explore without needing to build the entire AndroidX package.
